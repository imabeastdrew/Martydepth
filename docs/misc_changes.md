# Model Architecture Changes - NaN Fixes

## Changes Made to `OnlineTransformer`

### 1. Layer Normalization Fix
- Moved LayerNorm creation from forward pass to `__init__`
- Added proper module members:
  ```python
  self.pre_transformer_norm = nn.LayerNorm(embed_dim)
  self.final_norm = nn.LayerNorm(embed_dim)
  ```
- Initialized LayerNorm parameters properly:
  ```python
  nn.init.constant_(self.pre_transformer_norm.weight, 1.0)
  nn.init.constant_(self.pre_transformer_norm.bias, 0.0)
  nn.init.constant_(self.final_norm.weight, 1.0)
  nn.init.constant_(self.final_norm.bias, 0.0)
  ```

### 2. Weight Initialization
Added proper initialization for all weights:
- Embeddings:
  ```python
  nn.init.normal_(self.token_embedding.weight, mean=0.0, std=1.0 / math.sqrt(embed_dim))
  nn.init.normal_(self.position_embedding.weight, mean=0.0, std=1.0 / math.sqrt(embed_dim))
  ```
- Output Head:
  ```python
  nn.init.normal_(self.output_head.weight, mean=0.0, std=1.0 / math.sqrt(embed_dim))
  nn.init.zeros_(self.output_head.bias)
  ```

### 3. Transformer Layer Configuration
- Switched to Post-LN for initial stability:
  ```python
  norm_first=False  # Changed from True
  ```

### 4. Removed Numerical Stability Band-aids
- Removed `nan_to_num` calls that were masking issues
- Removed logit clipping that was hiding instability
- Removed try/except blocks around transformer forward pass

### 5. Embedding Scaling
- Removed embedding scaling since model wasn't trained with it:
  ```python
  # Removed: token_embeds = token_embeds * math.sqrt(self.embed_dim)
  ```

## Results
- Model now trains without NaN values
- Initial logits range: [-5.33, 5.60]
- First epoch metrics:
  - Train Loss: 3.5700
  - Valid Loss: 1.5114

## Note
These changes require retraining the model from scratch since they modify the architecture and initialization. The model cannot use old checkpoints trained with the previous architecture.
